# iNotebook - Online Note-Taking App

iNotebook is a feature-rich online note-taking application that empowers users to create, edit, and access their notes conveniently using their account credentials. This project is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, ensuring a seamless and secure note-taking experience.

## Getting Started

To run the iNotebook project locally, you'll need to set up both the frontend and backend components. Below are the steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software and tools installed:

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/): Node.js is required to run the project.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): MongoDB should be installed and running to support the backend.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Git is needed for cloning the project repository.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the iNotebook repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/inotebook.git
   cd inotebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```shell
   cd backend
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure necessary environment variables, such as the database connection URL, JWT secret, etc.

5. Start the backend server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

6. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```shell
   cd ../frontend
   ```

7. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

8. Start the frontend development server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

Once the setup is complete, you can access the iNotebook application in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the specified frontend port).
